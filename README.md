# ADHD Coping flow charts, plans, tips, tricks, life hacks, questions

Flow charts for coping with different sides of ADHD, as found useful
by me and me only. Feel free to submit tips as GitHub issues.

I've made a simple HTML5 viewer for it, which you can access
on [github pages] of this repo.

The chart was created with a sort-of-mind-mapping software called 
MasterPlan, you can buy it [on Steam] for about 12.5 EUR / 15 USD,
or download a demo from [the itch page]. (I'm not affiliated.)
